# dual-purpose-graphing

Project to expand on the idea of multi audience science and how data can be presented to achieve different purposes. If an experiment is done and there are important findings the key findings should be shared in a way that is clear and as simple as possible so an 8 year old can understand it. In some cases color can improve understanding of the data but may not be allowed in all areas where the findings will be presented.

This can be achieved with simple if statements to display one output or the other depending on the purpose; in the case of ColorBlind if the purpose of the graph is for a formal research paper the graph should be in black and white. In other cases it should use color to emphasise it's point.
