# dual-purpose-graphing

Project to expand on the idea of multi audience science and how data can be presented to achieve different purposes. It is important that key findings be both elegant and clean in their appearance. 

This can be achieved with simple if statements to display one output or the other depending on the purpose; in the case of ColorBlind if the purpose of the graph is for a formal research paper the graph should be in black and white.
